# Bank-Account
This program allows you to use a bank account interface that lets you withdraw, deposit, and view transactions. 

HOW TO:
Download the files and go to the src->BankAccountGUI to use the interface in Eclipse IDE.
Here is a demo in case you just want a quick look: ![Bank-Account-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59658246/93869477-128a6400-fc89-11ea-8e59-1e6152b538b5.gif)

TECHNOLOGY USED:
I used Java in the Eclipse IDE, and implemented the basics of object-oriented programming such as encapsulation and inheritence.

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:
This was originally an assignment to understand object-oriented programming. Having built my understanding of those concepts over the course of the class, this program was more of a fun challenge to implement a GUI with a Java program. Designing this program also made me think about how I spend my own money and has gotten me interested in the world of investment. 
I also got some great ideas from my friends (the big one was showing the red text when you withdrew too much money). My teacher has also been a huge help by being every so patient and kind.
